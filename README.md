# Battleship

Multiplayer 1v1 battleship game on CLI

## Starting the game

* Player 1 places his ships
* Player 2 places his ships
* Players take turn trying to guess where the enemy ships are

## Coordinate System

Coordinates are zero-indexed and relative to the top left

## Limitations

Does not check if coords entered are in the corect format or in range of the grid (going to cause a syntax error)

Does not have limitations on what ships are entered (if there are actually 17 ships tiles and all ships are of corect size)
